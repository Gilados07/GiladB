                <p>Riddles have been a part of human culture for thousands of years. They have been used to entertain,
                    challenge, and even teach. In today's era, riddles continue to be a popular pastime, but they have
                    also taken on a modern twist.</p>
                <P>Gone are the days of simple riddles that could be solved with a single answer. Today's riddles are
                    more complex, incorporating wordplay, puns, and cultural references. They often require critical

                    once relevant may no longer be applicable in today's society. For example, a riddle about a horse
                    and carriage would have been well-understood in the 19th century, but it might not make sense to
                    someone in the 21st century.</p>
